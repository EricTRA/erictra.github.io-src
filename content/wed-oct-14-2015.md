Summary: Let me introduce myself

I'm the kind of guy that you would want on your IT team, especially when that team is involved 
with Linux in any way. With over 25 years of experience in IT and a very broad knowledge others 
consider me a Guru. That however is not how I would call myself ever. 

As it states in my LinkedIn profile I'm a service oriented, process and procedure driven person.
