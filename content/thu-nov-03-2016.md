Summary: Changes are imminent, the new higher management will enter 'function' on December 1, 2016.

With the current ongoing situation of eternal competition between companies in the industry 
I work in, changes were to be expected. We will go from a development driven company to an 
operations driven one, FINALLY!

**Fact: development driven has a very high cost on stability and security**.... 
Developers always want to have their mits into everything, have all privileges and rights
and deploy live to production. Well, that's living in Utopia for ya...
 
That would only work if you have all the necessary frameworks in place and rigorous testing
is done on every line of code that goes into production. Talking about testing, that's exactly
what we're missing out on at work. Finally I freed up time from ELK now that we're 
getting in an external consultant to help out so I'm brushing up on my Python at last and put
it to good use.

To be continued...
